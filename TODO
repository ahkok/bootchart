Current TODO list:

* Remove hard-coded arrays over [MAXSAMPLES] and allocate arrays
dynamically for "samples" at run time.
* Parse /etc/os-release instead of all the rest (patch exists from
Koen Kooi)
* Write out idle time to the console?
* Revamp the idle time algorithm or delete it - it fails badly on
most things that are more powerful than an old core2.
