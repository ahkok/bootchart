#
# How long do I make my graph?
#
# Preferably, you record enough time so that the entire boot process
# is recorded in the bootchart, plus some extra. The default recording
# samples/freq is 20secs.  So, if you want to record 30secs instead of
# 20secs, you'll have to increase the amount of samples to 30*25 = 750.


#
# samples - how many samples total to record
#
#samples=500

#
# freq - how many samples per second to record
#
#freq=25

#
# rel - do not graph anything before the first sample is recorded.
#
# This is useful when running bootchart if the system is already up for
# a long time, in which case the monotonic clock will be so large that
# the graph would be unworkably large, as by default the graph starts
# at 0 (kernel boot start).  Set this to 1 if you run bootchart from
# the cmdline.
#
#rel=0

#
# filter
#
# filter out insignificant processes from the process chart. This makes
# the process chart a lot more compact, but you'll not be able to see
# shortlived processes or processes that don't actually use any
# measurable (< 0.001sec) CPU time.
#
#filter=1

#
# alternative output folder
#
#output=<folder name, defaults to /var/log>

#
# path to non-standard init
#
#init=/path/to/init

#
# PSS graph - memory usage graph
#
# Enabling this option will make bootchart log PSS usage from /proc/*/smaps
# for each process, which is highly CPU intensive. You're advised to
# lower the 'freq' value. Expect many dropped samples - PSS measurement
# can take up to 1sec of time on an average Atom platform.
#
#pss=0

#
# scale_x - horizontal graph scale
#
# Modifies the default horizontal (time) scale factor.  The number given
# specifies the amount of pixels that one second worth of time is wide
# in the graph. So, a higher value equals longer graph.
#
#scale_x=100

#
# scale_y - vertical graph scale
#
# Modifies the default vertical scale factor. The number given specifies
# the amount of pixels given in the graph to vertical aspects of the
# elements. In the PS graph, 16px equals scale_y=20. A higher value
# equals a taller graph.
#
#scale_y=20
